# Project of Drum Kit
### TARGET
In this project a static web page for rhythmic expression built with only HTML, CSS & JavaScript. This project uses .wav audio files and keypress events to turn the user's keyboard into a drum set.
In this project:
* Basically we try to develop Javascript. We use different javascript files for each task such as listener, handler..
* We did this project as a group. One is project manager. we did this page in one repository. we share our tasks and then collaborate. this is also important for the real job life.   
### INSPIRATION

## Notes

Studying this project we learned about:

* Dynamically setting classes
* Using the `<audio>` tag and .wav assets
* How the query selector can be used to easily interact with many elements
* How milestones, labels & issues can help organize work ->
  * user stories === milestones
  * tasks === issues
  * labels === what type of task it is

We struggled with:

* How to create the development strategy.  It was tricky to figure out that the `playHandler` can actually work without changing the `.played` class, once that was clear it was easier to create the _Keys Light Up_ user story.
* We kept making mistakes with the `data-key` attributes and linking the wrong keys and sounds.
* Merge Conflicts!  whoever invented these has no soul
* Keeping track of all the branches and forks.  OMG, github is confusing
* `transition` and `transforms` are new things for us. 

These resources were very helpful:
